                    <li>
                        A lab in algodynamics represents an algorithm. You can start learning about the associated
                        algorithm by opening the Lab's home page and going through the experiments in the order they are
                        listed in a lab. Each experiment introduces a new concept. You need to use this new concept and
                        concepts learnt in previous experiments of the same lab to solve the problem.

            <li class="py-3"><strong>How are these experiments built?</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        These experiments are built using Functional Reactive Programming Language called Elm. The
                        syntax of this language
                        matches the transition systems used for developing the experiments. Currently, we are building
                        the foundational
                        libraries and very soon they will be available to educators to create their own experiments.

                        This pedagogy is a part of ongoing research. You can visit <a

                        We are working on adding support for reporting bugs, will release it soon.

                        Yes, we are using cookies for identifying same users across various experiments. We are also
                        collecting data about the interactions performed in experiments for analyzing students'
                        learning. The collected data is stored as logs (anonymous, with just a random user-id) on our
                        analytics server.
                        You can disable cookies or decline the consent and the experiments can still be viewed with the
                        exact same
                        functionality and no data every being stored.

                        basic analytics available soon.

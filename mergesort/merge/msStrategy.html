	  <p>
	    The objective of this experiment is to introduce the concept of
	    “merging” two lists and to demonstrate that merging is a special case
	    of shuffling.
	  </p>
	  
	  <h1 class="py-2 text-xl text-gray-800 font-semibold"> Experiment Setup </h1>
	  <p class="py-1">
	    You are provided with two arrays "left" and "right" and
	    your goal is to merge these two arrays to form the
	    "merged" array using the "Left" and "Right" buttons
	    provided.
	  </p>

	  <p class="py-1">
	    The "Left" button picks the first element from the "left"
	    array and places it at the end of the "merged" array.
	    Similarly, the "Right" button picks the first element from
	    the "right" array and places it at the end of the "merged"
	    array.
	  </p>

	  <p class="py-1">
	    At any point during the experiment, the arrays can be one
	    of the two states: sorted or unsorted.  The sorted arrays
	    will be shown in green color whereas the unsorted arrays
	    will be shown in red color.
	  </p>

	  <h1 class="py-2 text-xl text-gray-800 font-semibold"> Procedure </h1>
	  <ol class="list-decimal list-inside">
	    <li class="py-1">
	      Compare the first elements of the "left" and "right"
	      arrays.
	    </li>
	    <li class="py-1">
	      If the first element of the "left" array is smaller then
	      add this element to the "merged" array by clicking on
	      the "Left" button.  Observe that the "Right" button will
	      be disabled in this case.  Similarly if the first
	      element on the "left" array is larger then you will pick
	      the element from the "right" array.
	    </li>
	    <li class="py-1">
	      Continue until both left and right arrays are empty.
	    </li>
	  </ol>

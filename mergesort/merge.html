	  <h1 class="py-2 text-xl text-gray-800 font-semibold"> Objective </h1>
	  <p>
	    The objective of this experiment it to demonstrate to the user that is
      possible to sort a list by repeatedly merging adjacent sorted
      subarray.
	  </p>
	  
	  <h1 class="py-2 text-xl text-gray-800 font-semibold"> Experiment Setup </h1>
	  <p class="py-1">
	    You are provided with one array , the each element in the array has indices
      marked on either side of it. The number on the left side of element indicates its 
      index.
	  </p>

    <p class="py-1">
      Clicking on the index boundary selects that index, clicking a selected boundary will 
      deselect it.
    </p>

	  <p class="py-1">
	    You can select three of these indices. If you choose three indices "i","j"and "k", 
      such that "i" &lt; "j" &lt; "k" , then the two sublists will be "i" to "j", 
      and "j" to "k", both excluding the the element at the last index, that is first list does 
      not have jth element and second sublist will not have kth element. 
	  </p>

	  <p class="py-1">
	    The selected sublist will be highlighted. The "Merge" button will merge the 
      selected sublists. Merging unsorted sublist will not give sorted result.
	  </p>

	  <h1 class="py-2 text-xl text-gray-800 font-semibold"> Procedure </h1>
	  <ol class="list-decimal list-inside">
	    <li class="py-1">
	      Pick the first index by clicking on the index boundaries. Similarly pick second 
        index, make sure all elements between first and second index are sorted. Third index 
        should be picked in the same fashion. 
	    </li>
	    <li class="py-1">
	      Click "Merge" and observe the sublists. See if the whole array becomes sorted or not.
        If array is not sorted repeat the above steps. 
	    </li>
	    
	  </ol>
